## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes 2,200+ opportunities across 18 BD reps and 23 Sales reps (413 unique pairings) to identify optimal BD-Sales team pairings and provide data-driven routing recommendations.

### Business Problem
Not all BD-Sales pairings perform equally. Random lead routing leads to:
- Suboptimal win rates
- Longer sales cycles  
- Higher early deal death rates
- Inconsistent pipeline health

### Solution
Analyze historical pairing performance to:
1. Identify high-performing BD-Sales combinations
2. Flag at-risk pairings to avoid
3. Provide actionable routing recommendations
4. Quantify expected business impact in ARR



## 🎯 Key Findings

**Expected ARR Improvement: $600K+** (annual recurring revenue lift from optimized routing)

- **18 BDs analyzed** with varying pairing performance ranges
- **Top 3 BDs** show $100K+ ARR improvement potential each
- **124-point performance swing** between best and worst routing decisions for some BDs
- **$0 implementation cost** - pure routing logic optimization

## 📈 Analysis Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Simulated 2,200 opportunities spanning 2 years
- 18 BD reps × 23 Sales reps = 413 possible pairings
- Tracked: Win rate, early death rate, stale pipeline rate, deal size

### 2. Metric Calculation
Four key metrics calculated for each pairing:
- **Win Rate**: % of decided opportunities that closed won
- **Early Death Rate**: % of lost deals that died within 14 days
- **Stale Pipeline Rate**: % of open deals inactive for 90+ days
- **Average Deal Size**: Mean deal value

### 3. Performance Scoring
- **Baseline Comparison**: Each pair compared to that BD's average (controls for lead quality)
- **Percentage Deviation**: Relative performance vs baseline
- **Weighted Scoring**: Equal 25% weight per metric
- **Confidence Multiplier**: Based on opportunity count (threshold: 7)

### 4. Classification
Percentile-based classification:
- **High Performer**: Top 25% (75th percentile+)
- **Above Average**: 50th-75th percentile
- **Average**: 25th-50th percentile
- **Below Average**: 10th-25th percentile
- **At-Risk**: Bottom 10%

## 🚧 Challenges Encountered

### 1. Baseline Selection Challenge

**Problem**: How do we fairly compare pairings when different BDs pass different quality leads?

**Initial Approach**: Compare all pairings to company-wide average
- **Issue**: Didn't account for BD lead quality differences
- Enterprise BDs naturally have lower win rates than SB BDs

**Solution**: Compare each pairing to that BD's average (BD baseline)
- Controls for inherent lead quality from each BD
- Makes comparisons fair and actionable for routing decisions

**Impact**: This was the most critical methodological decision - completely changed the analysis validity


### 2. Circular Logic in BD Summary

**Problem**: When averaging all BD pairs' performance scores, results were close to zero

**Initial Reaction**: Thought there was a bug in the calculation

**Realization**: This is mathematically correct by design!
- We compare each pair to that BD's average
- Deviations naturally balance out (some above, some below)
- This is a feature, not a bug

**Solution**: 
- Documented this clearly in methodology
- Added explanation box to visualization
- Changed interpretation: "This measures pairing consistency, not absolute BD quality"

**Lesson Learned**: What looks like an error might be correct behavior - understand your methodology deeply

### 3. Confidence Threshold Selection

**Problem**: How many opportunities needed for reliable pairing analysis?

**Trial & Error**:
- Tried threshold of 3 opps → Too noisy, unreliable results
- Tried threshold of 10 opps → Lost too many pairings, insufficient data
- Tried threshold of 5 opps → Still some instability

**Solution**: Two-tier approach
- **Minimum threshold**: 3 opportunities (43% confidence)
- **Full confidence**: 7 opportunities (75th percentile in dataset)
- Apply confidence multiplier that scales linearly

**Impact**: Balances statistical reliability with data availability


### 4. Visualization Complexity

**Problem**: Initial visualizations tried to show everything at once - too overwhelming

**Examples of cuts made**:
- Sales Rep frequency analysis → Too complex for main dashboard
- Confidence vs Performance scatter → Interesting but not essential
- Multiple classification views → Chose most intuitive representation

**Solution**: 
- Focus on storytelling: Each dashboard has a clear narrative
- Progressive disclosure: Start simple (EDA), build to complex (recommendations)
- Keep "cut" visualizations in analysis folder for reference

**Lesson Learned**: Less is more - every chart must earn its place in the story


### 5. ARR Calculation Complexity

**Problem**: How do we estimate revenue impact when not all opportunities are closed?

**Initial thought**: Only count won deals
- **Issue**: Ignores the opportunity cost of poor routing

**Solution**: Calculate potential ARR based on win rate × deal value × volume
- Current: Actual win rate × avg deal × opportunities
- Optimized: Best pairing win rate × avg deal × opportunities
- Difference = ARR improvement potential

**Assumption**: Average deal size remains constant across pairings (reasonable for this analysis)

**Impact**: Provides compelling business case in dollar terms
